Bollinger Bands Trading Bot
Introduction
This repository contains a trading bot based on the Bollinger Bands technical indicator. The bot is implemented in Python and uses the pandas, numpy, and talib libraries. The code provides a basic framework for developing a Bollinger Bands-based trading strategy, and can be used as a starting point for further customization and testing.

Usage
To use the code, you will need to provide a CSV file containing historical price data for the financial instrument that you wish to trade. The file should have the following columns: date, open, high, low, close. The date column should contain timestamps in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

Once you have the price data, you can run the code by executing the following command in your terminal:

Copy code
python bollinger_bands_trading_bot.py
The code will calculate the Bollinger Bands and generate entry and exit signals based on the rules defined in the script. Finally, it will calculate the PnL for the strategy and plot the cumulative PnL.
